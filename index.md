## About Me

I am a (pre-)Ph.D. student (2024.03-) at Computer Vision and Learning Group ([VLG](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/)), [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), supervised by Prof. [Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html). Prior to this, I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science at ETH Zürich (2020.09-2023.04), advised by [Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html) and B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) (2016.09-2020.07), advised by [Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com/). 

## Research Interests

My research topic is neural implicit representation learning, clothed human avatar synthesis and more recently, human motion synthesis.
