## About Me

I am a (pre-)Ph.D. student (2023.10-) at the Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS), jointly supervised by [Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html) (ETH) and [Justus Thies](https://justusthies.github.io/) (MPI). I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich (2020.09-2023.04), advised by [Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html). Before that, I graduated with a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Peking University (2016.09-2020.07), advised by [Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com/). 

## Research Interests

My primary research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics. Particularly, I have developed a deep interest in digital human modeling and clothes modeling in recent years. Currently, I am focused on animatable clothed human avatar synthesis.
